# ConfigFileParser
PHP Script that iterates through text files and parses precise text. The script was intended as a way to extract specific pieces of data from auto-generated device configuration files of unpredictable content and length. Please use $PriStart, 
$SecStart and $Stop to edit the limiter (search) text.
